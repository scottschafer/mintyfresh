	<h1>What is this?</h1>
	
</div>

	<p>I made this tool partly to resolve my frustrations with mint.com, and partly as a way to learn angularjs. I'm not sure it will be useful for
		anyone but me, and I'm not even sure I will, but sometimes you just have to try...</p>

	<p>My main frustration with mint is that there is no way to create budgets that contain multiple categories. This means way too many budgets to manage, and these budgets are often dramatically different in size. Let's say your Food budget is $2000 and your Pets budget is $50. Now let's say you spent $3000 on Food but only $10 on Pets. Since mint shows the bars as the same size, it looks like you're winning at this budgetting thing.</p>

	<p>A secondary frustration I have is that some categories are useless to me. For example, I don't care whether mint thinks my dining out transactions belong under Fast Food, Restaurants, Coffee Houses, etc. I want a simple way to lump all transactions in any of these categories into "Restaurants" without having to recategorize transactions.</p>
	<p>

	<p>My goal is to present the transactions exported by mint (or any other tool that exports to CSV) in a way that is easily manageable, along the lines of <a href="http://budgeting.about.com/od/Budgeting_101/fl/Try-the-Simple-5-Category-Budget.htm">The Simple 5-Category Budget</a>.</p>

	<p>This is entirely client side - your transactions, categorizations and budgets are all stored in your computer's local storage.</p>
